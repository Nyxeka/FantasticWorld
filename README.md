The goal of fantastic world was to develop/design a universal control scheme any-mode way of interacting with an open world video game, with a powerful character creator.

This means essentially switching between any of the following camera+entity setups:

- first-person with a mouse or gamepad (or any controller setup you'd want)
- third-person FPS
- third person follow cam with a gamepad
- top-down point-and-click, (or any other control scheme)
- areas of the map designed to be a 2d platformer allowing for side-scroller gameplay

And more. The plan was to build an in-game node-graph editor:

that would allow users to map any input device to camera transform/motion especially relative to player position.
